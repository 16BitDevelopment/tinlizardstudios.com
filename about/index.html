                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Growing up in the beautiful countryside of Cornwall &amp; Sussex the natural world was my companion &amp; my joy. I have always felt a deep sense of belonging in the natural world, of being at home in the countryside. When I wasn&apos;t roaming the cool mossy woodlands, valleys &amp; shores of the lake, heather &amp; thyme covered cliffs &amp; secluded coves, I spent many contented hours drawing &amp; painting, trying to portray what I saw …&amp; looking beyond to see the unseen.</p>

            </div>
            <p>My family has several generations of artists who were a huge inspiration to me: generously sharing their skills, wide knowledge, quirky humour &amp; great love of nature.</p>
            <p>I was blessed with inspiring art teachers at my schools then went on to study Fine Arts at West Sussex College of Art &amp; Design.</p>
            <p>Then later, on my travels 50 years ago, I discovered New South Wales… quite by accident… &amp; despite the very different look, light &amp; feel of the landscapes, I immediately felt at home &amp; that sense of kinship with Nature. I decided to stay.</p>
            <p>Winning the Jack MacDonagh Award for painting in 1983 gave me the opportunity to study under Robert Wilson at Mitchell College, Bathurst, learning to see &amp; capture the subtle differences in light &amp; foliage.</p>
            <p>I mostly work in oils, pastels or drawing with various mediums &amp; occasionally revisit sculpture &amp; casting.</p>
            <p>In my work I try to see, to feel beyond the obvious perception, capture a certain light or mood, touch the heart. I hope to share the joy &amp; peace to be found when we realise our kinship with Nature….. &amp; if it&apos;s quirky, so much the better!</p>
            <p>Glenn Albrecht&apos;s vision for the future is wonderfully inspiring:</p>
            <p><i>“The Symbiocene will be that period in Earth&apos;s history where humans symbiotically re-integrate themselves, emotionally, psychologically &amp; technologically into nature and natural systems...utterly rejecting the current destructive despotism of the Anthropocene.”</i></p>
            <p>This is a vision for a future that humanity must embrace… There&apos;s no question that if we and all other species are to survive and thrive, we have to stop this mad rampage of destruction of our natural world &amp; learn to live in harmony with the natural systems, appreciating and respecting all life forms in our wonder-full interconnecting ecosystems, the multitude of ecosystems that all interconnect to make up the Earth.…this amazing matrix of Life….Our Life Support System.</p>
            <p>So over the years I have attempted to share this awareness through both my artwork &amp; by presenting community radio programs like State of the Environment &amp; more recently Celebrating Earth &amp; Art on River FM 92.9. The November 2024 exhibition “Seeking the Symbiocene” with Peter Nielsen at The Serpentine Gallery in Lismore, NSW is our attempt to inspire hope for the Symbiocene. I have exhibited solo &amp; with other artists &amp; groups in Australia &amp; overseas. I have work in private collections in Australia, the UK, Brittany, Monaco &amp; USA.</p>
